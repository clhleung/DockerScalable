This README is for HW 3. Group members: Clement Leung, Greg Chow, Jian Hao Miao



### How did we approached the assignement? ###

We tried out everything we thought would work and adjusted from there until stuff looked like it worked. Pure, simple, brute force.
Not the best method, but it can get the job done at times. 

### How we tested it ###

We used the test script and ran some its commands individually for testing. We also used curl commands to check for instances
where the program breaks



## Webiste Sources we used to help write hw 3 files

Stack overflow on questions related to dict and list manipulation in Python
