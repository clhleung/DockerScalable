This README is for HW 3. Group members: Clement Leung, Greg Chow, Jian Hao Miao

The main goal of the assignment was to add features to the kvs service so that it would be scalable, such the service can tolerate the addition and deletion of worker nodes through the service's lifetime. 

### How did we approached the assignement? ###

We tried out everything we thought would work and adjusted from there until we got tests working. 

### How we tested it ###

We used the test script and ran some its commands individually for testing. We also used curl commands to check for instances
where the program breaks



## Webiste Sources we used to help write hw 3 files

Stack overflow on questions related to dict and list manipulation in Python, as well as Docker docs to look for any issues we came across using Docker.
